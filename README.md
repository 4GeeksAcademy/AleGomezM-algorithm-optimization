Algorithm Optimization in Python
Step-by-Step Guide to Optimizing Python Code

Welcome to the Algorithm Optimization Project! This repository is designed to guide you through practical exercises to improve the efficiency and performance of Python code, step by step. Whether you're a beginner learning about algorithm optimization or a developer looking to sharpen your skills, this project will provide a hands-on approach to writing cleaner, faster, and more efficient code.

🌟 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to help you:

Understand common optimization techniques for Python algorithms.
Improve your problem-solving and coding skills by tackling real-world challenges.
Write code that is not only correct but also efficient.
You will be working through a series of exercises provided in a Jupyter Notebook, where you will analyze, optimize, and refactor Python code step by step.

📝 Instructions
Once you've set up the project, you will find a Jupyter Notebook at ./notebook/problems.ipynb containing a series of exercises.

Steps to Complete
Open the notebook file in your development environment.
Read each exercise carefully and follow the instructions provided.
Optimize the Python code as required, improving its performance and efficiency.
Test your solutions to ensure they work correctly and efficiently.
✅ Example Exercise
To give you an idea, here’s an example of an exercise you might encounter:

"Given an unsorted list of integers, write an optimized function to find the largest number. Compare its runtime before and after optimization."

Example of an unoptimized function:

def find_largest(nums):
    largest = nums[0]
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > largest:
            largest = nums[i]
    return largest
Optimized version:

def find_largest(nums):
    return max(nums)
💡 Why Algorithm Optimization Matters
Algorithm optimization is a critical skill for developers as it directly impacts the performance of applications, scalability, and user experience. By optimizing code:

You reduce runtime and memory usage.
You improve the scalability of applications.
You write cleaner, more maintainable code.
